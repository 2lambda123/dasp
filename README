The Durham AO Simulation Platform.

For installation instructions, see INSTALL.
Remember to set the correct environment variables (as described in INSTALL).

To get started, after installation, run daspbuilder.py (which should
be on your path). 
This will then guide you through the process of setting up your first
simulation.
