DASP
====

The Durham AO Simulation Platform.

For installation instructions, see INSTALL.
Remember to set the correct environment variables (as described in INSTALL).

To get started, after installation, run daspbuilder.py (which should
be on your path). 
This will then guide you through the process of setting up your first
simulation.  

DASP is a Monte-Carlo AO simulation code written in Python and C.  It
is modular and hugely flexible.  It can also be used to interface to
the DARC real-time control system.
