#	UB, 2012 Aug 09:
#	The next line (rm *.so) removes the .so files that were copied to cmod/ by the
#	"/src/Makefile: python setup.py install --install-lib=../" comand.
#	setup.py can not clean these files; they have to be removed "manually".
#	(Before 2012Aug09 they were removed by "rm ../*.so" in shmem/Makefile.generic.)
	##rm *.so # will fail if no .so files
	for x in *.so ; do if [ -r $$x.o ] ; then rm $$x.o ; fi ; done
