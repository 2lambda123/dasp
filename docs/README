This directory will eventually contain a comprehensive set of documentation
explaining the AOSIM architecture, model designs, and science capabilities.

To generate PDF documentation, type "make".  To read this documentation,
use "acroread file.pdf"

There is also some documentation in openoffice format (filename
*.sxw), use "ooffice file.sxw" to view.  This will eventually be
replaced by PDF documentation (latex source).

To see documentation use:
ls *.pdf *.sxw
