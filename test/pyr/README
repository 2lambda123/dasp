Simulation generated.
To run in pyrSim/, use:
python scao.py params.py
To view the simulation configuration, use:
daspsetup.py scao.xml
To connect to a running simulation (to view PSFs, WFSs, DMs, etc in action) use:
daspctrl.py
or:
daspanalyse.py

Please edit params.py to alter the simulation to meet your requirements.

Some notes about this simulation:
It will first of all take an interaction matrix.
This will then be inverted to give a control matrix, using a simple SVD.
This least-squares wavefront reconstructor will then be used for AO correction.

Several improvements are possible (left as an excercise for the user):
Minimum variance wavefront reconstruction from the interaction matrix.
Model-based reconstruction (e.g. CuReD, SOR, etc)

If you already have a control matrix, and thus do not need to generate one, you
can use --user=nopoke commandline option


Larger than default modulation rewquired:
python scao.py --iterations=1000 --init="gain=2.0;pyrModAmp=8"
Not sure why gain>1 also helps - probably due to matrix conditioning,
or the non-linearity....

To test: increasing padding during 2nd FFT...
