This test directory contains lots of examples for wide-field wavefront
sensing, e.g. solar, or extended LGS.

To run:
python testwidefield.py params.xml
This will run an example solar WFS.  WFS only, no recontruction,
centroiding etc.  It looks nice!


Or
python testwidefield.py paramsSci.xml
This will show a science image.

Or
python testwidefield.py paramsLgs.xml
10x10 LGS.

python testwidefield.py paramsPhaseD.xml
Canary Phase D LGS - extremely elongated off-axis launch LGS.  Note,
differential spot motion, i.e. the top and bottom of the plume move
differently.

python testwidefield.py paramsProfiler.xml
A 1D example, extremely elongated spot, 1 sub-aperture.

The testwidefieldNoDM.py does exactly the same as the above, but with
no DM.  Note, in the examples above, the DM wasn't used, but was
present as an example.



The best one to try:  A closed loop SCAO system:
python testwidefieldcentroid.py params.xml

Starts by doing a poke, then closes the loop.

This example also includes a narrowfield science source as a
performance metric.  Note - use StrehlPeak, not anything else, because
the image isn't always exactly on-axis - depending on the reference
slopes.
